<p>My name is Francisco Diez, I'm a biomedical engineering undergraduate at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·</p>
<p>I was always passionate about software development, and ever since I started my studies in de medical field engineering, I became really interested in software development applied to medical pourposes and data science.</p>
<p>That's why I started, parallel to my university studies, my own learning path with different online courses and books. Now I'm studiying C and Python with a data science approach.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, feel free to contact me through my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/fdiez1/'>LinkedIn account</a></p>
